\section{Overview of our approach}

We present a modular set of improvements designed to be composable:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cone pheromone initialization, adds directional bias toward goal.
  \item Adaptive pheromone/heuristic factors dynamically adjust $\alpha$ and $\beta$ over iterations.
  \item Division of labor and role assignment (explorers vs exploiters) with smooth transitions.
  \item Backtracking heuristics allow ants to recover from dead-ends efficiently.
  \item Smooth-line (B-spline) post-processing convert discrete waypoint lists into continuous trajectories.
  \item Finetune coordinated parameters so all features work together.
\end{enumerate}
A high-level algorithmic workflow is given, and detailed implementation notes are provided in Chapter 5.
