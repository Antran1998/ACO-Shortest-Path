\section{ACO overview}

This section provides a concise overview of Ant Colony Optimization as applied to grid path planning:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ant Colony Optimization basics: pheromone trails, heuristic information, probabilistic transition rules, pheromone evaporation and deposit.
  \item Heuristic design for grid navigation: distance heuristics, admissibility considerations when combining with ACO.
  \item Convergence issues: premature convergence, stagnation, and common mitigation strategies.
  \item Path quality metrics: node-count vs. Euclidean (geometric) length and runtime/statistical metrics for evaluation.
\end{itemize}
