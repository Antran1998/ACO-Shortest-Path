\section{Scope}

This report focuses on algorithmic improvements to ACO for static, known grid maps. The work:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Targets offline path planning and benchmark evaluation (no online dynamic re-planning).
  \item Uses occupancy-grid style maps provided in the project's maps/ folder.
  \item Evaluates improvements by numerical experiments (multiple runs) on benchmark maps.
  \item Does not address sensor noise, moving obstacles, or low-level control execution.
\end{itemize}
