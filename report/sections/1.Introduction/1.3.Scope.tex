\section{Scope}
This report is deliberately focused: we study algorithmic refinements to ACO for static, fully-known occupancy-grid maps and evaluate them in an offline, repeatable benchmarking setting. The maps used are the project's local `maps/` collection together with a chosen set of public benchmarks to ensure that results can be reproduced and compared.

The work concentrates on planner-level contributions such as search guidance, pheromone and heuristic adaptation, role specialization among ants, targeted backtracking, and B-spline smoothing as a post-processing step. We do not attempt to solve state estimation, sensor noise modelling, online dynamic re-planning, kinodynamic trajectory optimization, or low-level controller integration; these topics are outside the scope of this report, though the produced trajectories are designed to be compatible with downstream controllers.

Key assumptions and limitations are as follows. Maps are treated as static and fully observed, so the findings do not directly generalize to dynamic or partially-observed environments. Performance comparisons are made via offline metrics and aggregated statistics; absolute wall-clock numbers will depend on implementation and hardware but relative trends are valid when measured on the same platform. Finally, smoothing is applied as a post-processing stage—detailed dynamics-aware trajectory optimization is left for future work.
