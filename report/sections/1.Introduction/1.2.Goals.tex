\section{Goals}

The primary goals of this project are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Improve ACO convergence speed and robustness on grid benchmarks.
  \item Reduce geometric path length (Euclidean) rather than node count.
  \item Produce smooth, continuous paths suitable for motion controllers through post-processing.
  \item Design complementary improvements that operate together without destructive interference.
  \item Provide reproducible experiments and clear comparison to the baseline.
\end{enumerate}
