\section{Adaptive Pheromone / Heuristic Factors (Như)}

\subsection{Idea}
Dynamically adapt $\alpha$ and $\beta$ during iterations to encourage exploration early and exploitation later.

\subsection{Implementation}
Use a smooth schedule (e.g. quadratic/integral schedule):
\[
\alpha'(n) = \alpha + \xi \left(\frac{n}{N}\right)^2/2,\quad
\beta'(n) = \beta + \xi \left(\frac{n}{N}\right)^2/2
\]
Tune $\xi$ to control adaptation strength.

\subsection{Benefits}
Reduces premature convergence and balances exploration/exploitation.

\subsection{Experimental results}
Include comparison tables/plots showing effect of adaptive scheduling on path quality and variance.
