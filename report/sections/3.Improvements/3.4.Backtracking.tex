\section{Backtracking (Phước)}

\subsection{Idea}
Allow ants to perform controlled backtracking when encountering dead-ends or low-quality branches instead of restarting immediately.

\subsection{Implementation}
Implement a lightweight backtrack policy that revisits recent nodes with probability based on local pheromone/heuristic cues and a maximum backtrack depth.

\subsection{Benefits}
Reduces wasted exploration steps, increases probability of discovering valid routes in constrained regions.

\subsection{Experimental results}
Include measurements showing success rate improvements on maps with narrow corridors or many obstacles.
