\section{Smooth Line (B-spline) (Thương)}

\subsection{Idea}
Post-process discrete grid paths using cubic B-spline interpolation to create continuous, smooth trajectories suitable for controllers.

\subsection{Implementation}
Convert grid waypoint sequence to control points, apply cubic B-spline with chosen smoothing factor and sample densely to form the final trajectory.

\subsection{Benefits}
Removes sharp corners, yields C2-continuous curves, increases point density for motion planning.

\subsection{Experimental results}
Provide before/after figures and quantitative change in curvature/point density.
