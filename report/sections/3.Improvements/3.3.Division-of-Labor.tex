\subsection{Idea}
Assign dynamic roles to ants (e.g. explorers vs exploiters) with a smooth transition based on iteration progress and convergence metrics.

\subsection{Implementation}
Define a sigmoid-based mixing coefficient to determine role proportions. Configure different $(\alpha,\beta)$ scalings per role.

\subsection{Benefits}
Improves runtime efficiency and can speed convergence by leveraging specialized search behaviours.

\subsection{Experimental results}
Report trade-offs: faster runtime vs. potential increase in variance; include runtimes and path statistics.
